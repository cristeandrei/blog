Among its functionalities are: entries can be organised in accounts, files can be attached to entries, each account can be organised in multiple sub-accounts and so forth for better organization, common accounts so multiple users can add entries, notifications in case the accounts reached a certain sum, set notifications that trigger at a chosen interval for invoice remainders, creates useful graphs for tracking spending.\nGithub Repo\nThis was my first big application, because of that and my lack of foresight I didn’t documented the development process, so all I have to offer is a github repo with a bunch of questionable code( don’t worry I got better, probably), a user guide for a app that will never be deployed again and a schema of the data that used to be store on Firestore. With all that I think its fitting that my first post here to be the first more complex app I made.\nTechnologies and libraries used  React Material UI Redux Toolkit React Router DOM Firebase Authentication Firestore Firebase Functions Firebase Messaging Firebase Store Workbox React Chartjs 2 MomentJs React Material UI Form Validator React Icons Uuid  Database This is how the data stored in Firestore looks looks like. We have 5 collections, the collections called Fluxes and Lines represents the accounts and entries that we described in the About section.\nFluxes Fluxes are used to group our entries. The balance field represents the sum of all the entries in a specific flux, the totalBalance field takes in considerations the entries from fluxes nested in a flux. This two fields are updated each time we modify, delete or add entries. The path array stores data about the path to we must traverse to reach the current flux from the root flux, this is used for generating breadcrumbs for a easier navigation between fluxes. There are two types of fluxes, fluxes where just one user can add manage them and fluxes that can be managed by multiple users. We can tell witch type of flux we are dealing with by checking the type field, for single users we have the ‘flux’ string and for multi user ones we have the ‘group’ string. The userId field keeps track of all the users that have access to a flux. When adding a user to a flux, we also add it to all the nested fluxes of that flux. The subscribedBudgets filed keeps track of the budgets that one flux is part of.\nLines The only thing special about the lines collections are the fileName and url fields. They are present only when we have entries that we attached a file to. The url links to our storage in Firebase Storage.\nGraphs When we create a graph there are two things that we can modify to get our desired graph. The data that we want to use, this is done by providing the list of fluxes from witch we want to get data from and storing it in fluxList, and a time range so if we want we can only get data from a specific period stored in the fromDate and toDate fields. Additionally we can chose how our data is grouped in the timeFormat field, we have three options: days, months and years. For example if we chose months all the entries in a month is added up and used when constructing our graph.\nUsers Additionally to the usual things that we store in a users table, here we also store tokens. A token is generated when we login, updated in the database and cleared when we logout. They are used in serverless functions to send notifications to users on all the devices they are logged in.\nBudgets Notting special , just data about what limit we set for our budget, the users that have access to the budget, a detailed list with all the fluxes subscribed to the budget and a totalBalance of the budget.\nTasks Now here is a more interesting collection. This tasks are queried every minute from a Firebase Function program so we can send notifications to users that got past their limit on one budget( in case the budget has multiple users they are notified too) or to users that have set timed remainders( here we can also have multiple notifications). Because of that in the type field we can have \" budgetNotification\" or “invoiceNotification”. The worker field stores what kind of notification we send, we have notifications that are send just to a single user called “sendDeviceMessage” and notifications to multiple users called “sendMultipleDeviceMessage”. The status field can be “scheduled” if every thing is ok and the notification is scheduled to be send eventually or “error” if something has happened and i couldn’t be send. This is useful because the user will be made aware in the UI and can reset the notification. PerformAt is just the that when the notification will be send. The options object stores data about the interval at witch the notification will be send, its content and to whom we will send the notification to.\nAuthentication In-app authentication can be done in two ways depending on your user account, either using your account email and password, or using your Google account by pressing the Google logo button.\nCreating an account There are two types of user accounts, one is created through an email address and a password, and the other is through a Google Account. The difference between the two types of accounts is that when choosing to create an account using an email address, the user chooses their username directly, unlike accounts created using the Google platform, the username of these users being the gmail address. If you want to change your username, you can do this in the account screen. The email address and username are unique to each user. Creating an account does not require email verification, it is only used for password recovery.\nPassword reset Resetting the password is done by clicking “Forgot Password? ” in the login screen. In case of a successful reset an email will be sent to the specified email address with instructions for resetting the password.\nHome screen After logging in we are redirected to the home screen of the application. From this screen we can navigate the fluxes we create, add entries to them, edit existing fluxes and entries, and add budget or chart subscriptions to fluxes.\nBottom actions In the bottom bar of the application are the buttons used for performing actions on the current flux or for displaying information about it. Holding down one of these buttons displays a tooltip with a description of the action performed by each button.\nCreating a flux Clicking on the “Add” icon in the lower right corner opens the menu for actions that can be performed on a flux. Then press the “Add Flux” button.\nIt opens the flux creation dialog. Here you can select the name of the stream and whether it should be added to the budgets to which the parent stream is subscribed (if the parent stream does not belong to any budget this option is not available).\nFlux navigation If there are fluxes that can be navigated then a menu called “Fluxes” appears under the application bar, when pressed it expands, displaying all the fluxes that can be navigated from the current flux. Clicking on such a flux redirects us to the selected flux.\nTo navigate back to the fluxes we’ve been in, we use the list of links above the “Fluxes” menu. When we click on such a link we are redirected to that flux.\nFlux info and edit dialog The menu for editing and displaying information is opened by pressing the “Info Flux” button accessible from the bottom action bar of the application in the “Info” menu.\nIn this menu you can see the date of creation of the flux, the name, the total value of the entries strictly in this flux as well as the total value of the entries in this flux and in the fluxes belonging to it. Pressing the “Edit” button makes it possible to edit the flux name. The “Delete Flux” button deletes the flux, the entries associated with it, and any subscription it has of one of the budgets or charts created. Deleting a flux also triggers deleting fluxes that belong to it. If we want to delete only the records of the selected flux we can use the \" Delete Lines” button.\nCreating an entry There are two types of entries that can be created. Simple, they are defined by a entrie value and a name. In addition, there is the option of entries with an attached file. The dialog for creating any type of entrie can be accessed from the “Add” button at the bottom right.\nFile progress All files being uploaded can be seen in the lower left corner of the “Pending Files” menu. The number of files being uploaded is displayed in the corner of the “Pending Files” icon. When pressed, a list of file progress is displayed.\nEntry edit After creating a entrie, it will be displayed under the flux navigation menu. Clicking on an entry opens a dialog that displays information about it and makes it possible to edit or delete it. In case of editing, its name and value can be changed. Entries that are accompanied by a file provide an “Open Link” link for downloading that file.\nNavigation Navigation is done through the application sidebar. Clicking on the icon in the upper left corner (when using mobile devices can also swipe from left to right), opens the menu where all the application screens are listed. By clicking \" Budgetix\" in the application bar we are redirected to the home page.\nMulti user fluxes From the navigation menu you can access the fluxes for groups, the difference between them and the normal fluxes is the possibility to add other users to them. All users who belong to a flux can make changes to it and add or remove other users. Subfluxes created in such a flux can be accessed by all users of the parent flux.\nAdding users to multi user fluxes To add a user to a multi user flux, click on the “Add” menu in the lower left corner followed by pressing the “Subscribe User” button. This button opens a dialog where we can enter the username of an existing user to add it to the flux.\nRemoving users from multi user fluxes To remove a user added to a multi user flux, click on the “Info” menu in the middle of the bottom bar of the application followed by pressing the “Subscribed Users” button. This button opens a dialog containing a list of all users who have access to the flux we are in. By selecting one or more users and pressing “Delete” we can remove users from the current flux. If a user is also subscribed to a budget in the flux from which it was removed, it is also removed from that budget.\nBudgets Clicking on the “Budgets” icon in the left navigation menu accesses the budget screen. Here is a list of all the budgets you belong to and a way to create new budgets by pressing the “+” button at the bottom right.\nCreating a budget Pressing the “+” button at the bottom right opens the budgeting dialog. Here you can choose the name of the budget, its limit and users who want to be part of this budget.\nEdit or delete a budget Pressing the button with the pencil icon next to a budget opens the budget editing dialog. Here we can edit the budget name, its limit, and users who have access to the budget, or we can delete the budget. If we have single user fluxes subscribed to this budget then we can’t add other users.\nAdding fluxes to budgets Adding a flux to the budget is done through the “Add” menu on the main screen, by pressing the “Subscribe to budget” button. It opens a menu where we can see all the budgets we can subscribe this flux to and the budgets that the flux is already subscribed to.\nAt the end when you click “Submit” the budgets that are new in the “Chosen” column will be added to the flux subscription list and the budgets that were in the “Chosen” column but are now in the “Choices” column will be removed from the flux subscription list. We can also choose whether we want to subscribe only the fluxes we are in or whether we want to add the fluxes that belong in the current flux(note that all fluxes that start from the current flux are added) . If the budget has more users, they are added to the fluxes. For the fluxes that only we have access to, the budgets that have multiple users are not displayed.\nFlux info related to budgets Through the “Info” menu at the bottom of the application we can click on the “Budgets Subscriptions” button.\nHere we have a list of all the budgets to which a flux is subscribed. When we tap a budget in the list, we are redirected to the budget information screen.\nBudget info We can access this screen in two ways, through the “Info” menu at the bottom of the application we can click on the \" Budgets Subscriptions\" button or from the left navigation menu by pressing the “Budgets” button and selecting a budget from the list. A graphical representation of the fluxes subscribed to the budget can be seen in this screen and also a graphical representation of the relationship between the sum of all fluxes and the set limit represented in percentages. Budget information such as its limit and the amount of fluxes that are subscribed to it. A list of all the fluxes and their value. We can remove a flux from the budget by pressing the “x” button to the right of a stream. Here you can also see the notification that is automatically received when we exceed the set limit. It can be edited here by pressing the button represented by a pencil next to the notification.\nCreating a graph Graphics are created in the graphs screen, which can be accessed through the sidebar by clicking on the icon named \" Graphs\". There we have a list of all already created graphs.\nCreating a graph is done by pressing the button with the icon represented by an “+”. This button opens a dialog where we can enter the desired name for the created graph.\nEditing a created graph is done by pressing the button represented by the pencil icon. The open dialog makes it possible to edit a graph name or delete it. Clicking on a graph in the list opens the screen with information about it, its settings and the graph itself.\nAdding a flux to a graph Subscribing a flux to the graph is done in the same way as subscribing flux to a budget. Through the “Add” menu, pressing the “Subscribe to graph” button.\nGraphs and graphs settings To adjust the setting of a graph or to view it, select it in the Graphs screen. Graphs can be set to take only data from a specific period from subscribed fluxes. In addition, you can set how the flux data is calculated. There are three calculation options: grouping by day, grouping by month and grouping by year. Grouping means that for a point on the graph we use the sum of all records in a day, month, or year, depending on the setting chosen. The graphs show the total value of the flux at a given date and the value with which it increased or decreased. There is also a list of fluxes on this page, you can delete a flux by pressing the minus button in a black circle next to it.\nNotifications The notifications screen can be accessed from the sidebar.\nHere you can create new notifications, edit existing notifications, put certain notifications on hold, or delete notifications. There are two types of notifications, user-created, or automatically created when a budget is exceeded. To create a notification we must provide the date we want to receive the notification, the notification message, and the number of days it must pass before the notification is resend. The creation is done by pressing the button on the bottom right represented by a bell with a plus in the middle.\nTo edit, you can click on a notification in the list. To disable a notification we use the switch to the right of it.The switch is replaced by an exclamation point in a black circle in case of an error, it is recommended to delete the notification and create a new notification.\nEdit account info The user account can be edited via the “Account” button in the left navigation menu. You can change your username for both types of accounts. For accounts created using email and password, it is possible to change the password or email. Editing is done by clicking on the desired field, this action triggers the opening of a dialog in which we can enter the new info. The password must also be entered to edit the email.\nExit the app Exiting the application is done by pressing the “Logout” button in the sidebar.\n","wordCount":"2914","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-07-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-07-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrei Criste"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://cristeandrei.github.io/blog/posts/projects/personal-finances/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cristeandrei.github.io/icons/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

<p>Mobile first PWA for keeping track of expenses and income. Among its functionalities are: entries can be organised in
accounts, files can be attached to entries, each account can be organised in multiple sub-accounts and so forth for
better organization, common accounts so multiple users can add entries, notifications in case the accounts reached a
certain sum, set notifications that trigger at a chosen interval for invoice remainders, creates useful graphs for
tracking spending.</p>

<p>This was my first big application, because of that and my lack of foresight I didn&rsquo;t documented the development process,
so all I have to offer is a github repo with a bunch of questionable code( don&rsquo;t worry I got better, probably), a
user guide for a app that will never be deployed again and a schema of the data that used to be store on Firestore. With
all that I think its fitting that my first post here to be the first more complex app I made.</p>

have the &lsquo;group&rsquo; string. The userId field keeps track of all the users that have access to a flux. When adding a user to
a flux, we also add it to all the nested fluxes of that flux. The subscribedBudgets filed keeps track of the budgets
that one
flux is part of.</p>
<h3 id=lines>Lines<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#lines>#</a></h3>
<p>The only thing special about the lines collections are the fileName and url fields. They are present only when we have
entries
that we attached a file to. The url links to our storage in Firebase Storage.</p>
<h3 id=graphs>Graphs<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#graphs>#</a></h3>
<p>When we create a graph there are two things that we can modify to get our desired graph. The data that we want to use,
this is done
by providing the list of fluxes from witch we want to get data from and storing it in fluxList, and a time range so if
we want we can only get data from a
specific period stored in the fromDate and toDate fields. Additionally we can chose how our data is grouped in the
timeFormat field, we have
three options: days, months and years. For example if we chose months all the entries in a month is added up and used
when constructing our graph.</p>
<h3 id=users>Users<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#users>#</a></h3>
<p>Additionally to the usual things that we store in a users table, here we also store tokens. A token is generated when we
login, updated in
the database and cleared when we logout. They are used in serverless functions to send notifications to users on all the
devices they are logged
in.</p>
<h3 id=budgets>Budgets<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#budgets>#</a></h3>
<p>Notting special , just data about what limit we set for our budget, the users that have access to the budget, a detailed
list with
all the fluxes subscribed to the budget and a totalBalance of the budget.</p>
<h3 id=tasks>Tasks<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tasks>#</a></h3>
<p>Now here is a more interesting collection. This tasks are queried every minute from a Firebase Function program so we
can send notifications
to users that got past their limit on one budget( in case the budget has multiple users they are notified too) or to
users that have set timed
remainders( here we can also have multiple notifications). Because of that in the type field we can have "
budgetNotification" or &ldquo;invoiceNotification&rdquo;. The worker field stores what kind
of notification we send, we have notifications that are send just to a single user called &ldquo;sendDeviceMessage&rdquo; and
notifications to multiple
users called &ldquo;sendMultipleDeviceMessage&rdquo;. The status field can be &ldquo;scheduled&rdquo; if every thing is ok and the notification
is scheduled to be
send eventually or &ldquo;error&rdquo; if something has happened and i couldn&rsquo;t be send. This is useful because the user will be
made aware in the UI and
can reset the notification. PerformAt is just the that when the notification will be send. The options object stores
data about the interval at
witch the notification will be send, its content and to whom we will send the notification to.</p>
<h2 id=authentication>Authentication<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#authentication>#</a></h2>
<p>In-app authentication can be done in two ways depending on your user account, either using your account email and
password, or using your Google account by pressing the Google logo button.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60604692/159226301-262780ff-18d2-4796-b0af-58ae9fa73b38.jpg alt=auth>
</p>
<h2 id=creating-an-account>Creating an account<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#creating-an-account>#</a></h2>
<p>There are two types of user accounts, one is created through an email address and a password, and the other is through a
Google Account. The difference between the two types of accounts is that when choosing to create an account using an
email address, the user chooses their username directly, unlike accounts created using the Google platform, the username
of these users being the gmail address. If you want to change your username, you can do this in the account screen. The
email address and username are unique to each user. Creating an account does not require email verification, it is only
used for password recovery.</p>

<p>To adjust the setting of a graph or to view it, select it in the Graphs screen. Graphs can be set to take only data from
a specific period from subscribed fluxes. In addition, you can set how the flux data is calculated. There are three
calculation options: grouping by day, grouping by month and grouping by year. Grouping means that for a point on the
graph we use the sum of all records in a day, month, or year, depending on the setting chosen. The graphs show the total
value of the flux at a given date and the value with which it increased or decreased. There is also a list of fluxes on
